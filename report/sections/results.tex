\section{Results}

Show data from first potentiostat lab (graphs). Explain that we did salenize and platenize. Then talk about how we manufactured wafers and tried to test them. We had trouble getting this to work. Explain why. 

For potentiostat, we used a resistor to test its functionality (gui of graphs).
