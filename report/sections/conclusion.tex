\section{Conclusion}

An inexpensive home made potentiostat performs as well as an expensive lab based one. 
The potentiostat implementation is  much user friendly. Offloading all computations from microcontoller to desktop is much simpler and it facilitates taking more measurement per time. Providing constant voltage to reference electrode also gave us the same result.
